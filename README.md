# Myriad

Myriad is a new approach towards having actual fun with DAOs. It is a platform that allows you to create and participate in DAOs and also take them to Farcaster Frames which add a new layer of fun and excitement to the DAO experience.

## Features

-   [x] Create and participate in DAOs
-   [x] Convert your proposals to Farcaster Frames
-   [x] Voting on DAO proposals via Farcaster Frames
-   [ ] Manage treasury and funds via Farcaster Frames

## How it works

Myriad is built on top of the Farcaster protocol and uses PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) SDKs to provide a seamless experience for users.

We are using [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) to allow users to create and participate in DAOs using their Farcaster ID.

Via Farcaster ID, we assign a non custodial identity to the user and allow them to create and participate in DAOs. Semaphore takes care of the privacy and offchain computations required to pass the votes and proposals. Whilst Farcaster Frames are used to provide a fun and exciting experience to the users.

## Description

### Mission of the Project:

Enable decentralized governance: The project aims to empower individuals to participate in decentralized decision-making processes within DAOs, eliminating the need for centralized control.

Enhance privacy and scalability: It seeks to provide a secure and efficient platform for users to engage in DAO activities while maintaining privacy and scalability through the use of the Farcaster protocol and Semaphore.

Foster community involvement: By facilitating easy access to DAOs and providing a seamless user experience, the project aims to encourage broader community participation and engagement.

### Potential Uses:

Decentralized governance: The project can be utilized for decentralized governance within various types of organizations, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and community-driven initiatives.

Voting and decision-making: It enables users to participate in voting and decision-making processes within DAOs, allowing for transparent and democratic governance.

Community engagement: The platform can facilitate greater community involvement by providing a user-friendly interface and seamless access to DAO activities, fostering collaboration and participation.

Privacy-preserving interactions: Semaphore ensures privacy-preserving interactions within DAOs, allowing users to engage in sensitive discussions and transactions without compromising their privacy.

Scalable operations: By leveraging off-chain computations and scalability solutions, the project enables DAOs to handle a large number of transactions and activities efficiently, ensuring smooth operations and user experiences.
